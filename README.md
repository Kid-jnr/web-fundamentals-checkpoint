    -   _How does the web work_?
    -   _What_ do you need _to be a web developer?_
    -   Why did you choose to learn web development?

The web works through a system of interconnected technologies that allow users to access and share information over the internet. Hereâ€™s a simplified overview:

1.  **Web Browsers**: Users access the web through browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, which request web pages from servers.
    
2.  **Servers**: These are powerful computers that host websites and serve web pages to users upon request. When you enter a URL in your browser, a request is sent to the server hosting that web page.
    
3.  **HTTP/HTTPS Protocols**: These protocols facilitate the communication between browsers and servers, ensuring data is exchanged correctly.
    
4.  **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Web pages are built with these core technologies. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity.
    
5.  **Domain Name System (DNS)**: The DNS translates human-friendly domain names to IP addresses, directing your browser to the correct server.
    
6.  **Internet Backbone**: A global network of cables and data centers that transmit data between servers and users, enabling fast and reliable connections*
